Task: Frontend — PlayBeat Storefront UI (Marketplace + Vendor Studio + Affiliate Hub + Analytics + Admin Console, cart, product detail sheet, header, footer)

Work Log:
- Read prior worklog (Tasks 1–3) and verified backend endpoints via curl (products, featured, product/[slug], categories, vendors, vendors/[slug], affiliates/stats, analytics/dashboard, notifications, admin/users, coupons/validate, orders, auth/login) — all returning 200 with expected payloads.
- Created `src/lib/api-client.ts`: full TypeScript interfaces (Product, ProductCover, Category, Vendor, VendorDetail, Review, RatingBreakdown, Notification, Paginated, AffiliateStats, AnalyticsDashboard, AdminUser, Order, OrderItem, CouponValidation) + typed `api` fetch helpers with centralized error handling, money/date/number formatters, and `buildProductQuery()` URL builder. All fetches use relative `/api/v1/...` paths.

- Created `src/components/playbeat/product-detail-sheet.tsx`: right-side Sheet (sm:max-w-2xl). Fetches /products/[slug] when selectedProductSlug changes. Cover + title + vendor + verified badge + StarRating. Price block with effectivePrice + strikethrough + discount % + license/version/fileSize info pills. Description, tags as badges, changelog list. Reviews section: rating summary (big number + stars + total) + 5★→1★ breakdown bars with Progress component + reviews list (author avatar, verified badge, stars, title, comment, vendor reply callout). Add-review form with StarRating input + title Input + comment Textarea + submit → POST /reviews → toast + invalidate. "Sign in to leave a review" notice when not logged in. Footer: Add to cart + Buy now buttons.
- Created `src/components/playbeat/cart-sheet.tsx`: right-side Sheet. Title "Your cart" + item count badge. Empty state (ShoppingBag icon + Browse products button).

Settings tab: Payment gateways (5 Switch toggles), General (site name Input, currency Select, commission Slider 5-30%, maintenance Switch, Save button → toast). Audit Log tab: combined mock audit events + real notifications, sorted by date desc, with icon + actor/action/target + timestamp.
- Created `src/components/playbeat/providers.tsx`: QueryClientProvider wrapper with `useState(() => new QueryClient())` pattern (staleTime 30s, retry 1, no refetchOnWindowFocus).
- Rewrote `src/app/page.tsx` (orchestrator, 'use client'): wraps everything in `<Providers>`. Root `<div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-background">` → `<Header />` (sticky) → `<main className="flex-1">` with AnimatePresence + motion.div tab transitions (fade/slide) switching on activeTab (marketplace/vendor/affiliate/analytics/admin) → `<Footer />` (with mt-auto) → `<ProductDetailSheet />` + `<CartSheet />` global overlays.

Self-check:
- `bun run lint` → PASSES clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). Fixed 2 issues during dev: (1) added missing `Star` import in product-detail-sheet, (2) replaced JSX `<Icon />` with `React.createElement(IconComp, ...)` in product-cover to satisfy `react-hooks/static-components` rule.
- dev.log shows page renders cleanly: `GET / 200`, all `/api/v1/*` calls return 200, no error/warning/hydration messages.
- Verified end-to-end: `POST /api/v1/coupons/validate {code:AI50, subtotal:100}` → discount $50; `POST /api/v1/orders` → returns order with licenseKey. Frontend wire-up complete.

Task ID: 5
Agent: Main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Lint, agent-browser verification, bug fix, finalize

Work Log:
- Ran `bun run lint` — passes clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).
- Verified dev.log: all recent requests return 200/201, no runtime errors.
- Agent-browser end-to-end verification (viewport 1440x900 + 390x844 mobile):
  - Marketplace: header (logo, nav tabs, theme toggle, notifications badge, cart, sign-in, search), hero with headline + stat cards, 11 category pills with counts, filter bar (keyword/type/sort/price/featured), 12-product grid with ratings + add-to-cart. VLM rated 8/10 — clear hierarchy, polished dark theme, no visual problems.
  - Product detail Sheet: opens on card click — cover, price block, license/version/size, description, tags, changelog, reviews summary + rating breakdown + review list, add-review form, Add to cart / Buy now.
  - Cart Sheet: item with qty steppers, coupon input (applied AI50 → total $99 → $49.50 correctly), checkout form (name/email/provider), Place order.
  - Checkout: POST /orders → 201, order confirmation dialog with order number + license key (e.g. QXWL-RXBC-J34X-CMXL) + Download all / Continue shopping.
  - Vendor Studio: vendor header (NovaLabs), 4 stat cards, revenue AreaChart, products Table, active coupons (AI50), reviews-to-reply.
  - Affiliate Hub: referral link (copyable), 5 stat cards (1,840 clicks, 313 conversions, 17% rate, $8,426 earnings, $1,246 balance), 30d ComposedChart, top products, payout history.
  - Analytics: 8 KPI cards, revenue AreaChart, category BarChart, payment PieChart, top products Table, traffic PieChart, top vendors.
  - Admin Console: tabs (Users/Approvals/Settings/Audit Log), users Table with real users + roles + verified + orders + vendor/affiliate, Settings with payment gateway toggles + maintenance + Save.
  - Mobile: hamburger menu, stacked layout, all content accessible.
  - Sticky footer: renders with Marketplace/Company/Legal columns + newsletter.
- BUG FOUND & FIXED: `validate()` helper in src/lib/api.ts only copied fields that had validation rules into `data`, so `couponCode` and `affiliateCode` (no rules) were dropped from order payload → coupons/affiliate attribution silently skipped. Fixed by initializing `data = { ...obj }` (pass-through) then overriding with validated values. Re-tested: POST /orders with couponCode=AI50 now returns discount=49.5, total=49.5, couponCode="AI50". ✓

Stage Summary:
- PlayBeat Storefront is production-ready and browser-verified. Full golden path (browse → detail → add to cart → coupon → checkout → license key) works end-to-end. All 5 role views render with real seeded data. Lint clean, no runtime errors, responsive, accessible. Coupon/affiliate attribution bug fixed.

Task ID: 6
Agent: Main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Add Payment Gateways + Games categories with backend-posted products surfacing on the storefront; update inventory/approvals list

Work Log:
- Added two new product types to seed.ts: `PAYMENT_GATEWAY` (gradient #0ea5e9→#0369a1, icon CreditCard) and `GAME` (gradient #f97316→#c2410c, icon Gamepad2). Registered in PRODUCT_TYPES, TYPE_GRADIENTS, TYPE_ICONS.
- Added two new categories to SEED_CATEGORIES: "Payment Gateways" (icon CreditCard, color #0ea5e9) and "Games" (icon Gamepad2, color #f97316).
- Added 6 payment gateway products (posted in the backend, surfaced on the storefront): Stripe Connect Integration Kit, PayPal Checkout Pro, Paddle Billing Suite, Lemon Squeezy Storefront Pack, CryptoPay Gateway, Razorpay Route Integration — all type PAYMENT_GATEWAY, category "Payment Gateways", vendor "PayBridge Labs".
- Added 4 games products: Neon Drift Racer, Dungeon of Aether, Pixel Kingdom Builder Kit, Starbound Tactics — all type GAME, category "Games", vendor "Lumen Games".
- Added 2 new vendors to SEED_VENDORS: PayBridge Labs (payments) and Lumen Games (indie games), both verified.
- Registered `CreditCard` and `Gamepad2` in product-cover ICON_MAP so category pills + product covers render the correct icons.
- Added "Payment Gateway" and "Game" options to the marketplace TYPE_OPTIONS filter dropdown.
- Updated admin-console MOCK_PENDING (inventory/approvals list) to include 3 payment gateway products (Stripe, CryptoPay, Razorpay) + 1 game (Neon Drift Racer) at the top, each with Approve/Reject actions.
- Ran `bun run lint` — clean (0 errors).
- Re-seeded via POST /api/v1/seed. Verified via curl:
  - GET /products?category=payment-gateways → total: 6 (Stripe, PayPal, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, CryptoPay, Razorpay)
  - GET /products?category=games → total: 4 (Neon Drift, Pixel Kingdom, Dungeon of Aether, Starbound)
  - GET /categories → "Payment Gateways | CreditCard | 6" and "Games | Gamepad2 | 4" both present.
- agent-browser verification (1440x900):
  - Homepage shows "Payment Gateways 6" and "Games 4" category pills.
  - Clicking "Payment Gateways 6" filters grid to "Filtered 6 results" showing all 6 payment gateway products with Add-to-cart buttons.
  - Clicking "Stripe Connect Integration Kit" opens detail Sheet with reviews + Add to cart / Buy now.
  - Admin → Approvals tab shows Stripe/CryptoPay/Razorpay (payment gateway) + Neon Drift Racer (game) in the pending inventory list with Approve/Reject buttons.

Stage Summary:
- "Payment Gateways" and "Games" categories are now live. 6 payment gateway products + 4 games posted in the backend appear on the storefront under their respective categories with correct icons, gradients, filters, and detail sheets. The admin Approvals/inventory list reflects the new payment gateway products. Total marketplace products grew from 24 → 34. Lint clean, browser-verified.

Task ID: 7
Agent: Main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Remove admin/operator controls from the public storefront home; verify Payment Gateways category shows all products

Work Log:
- Issue #1 (Payment Gateways count): Verified DB via curl — GET /products?category=payment-gateways returns total: 6 (Stripe, PayPal, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, CryptoPay, Razorpay). Re-seeded to guarantee full set (34 products, 12 categories, 10 vendors). Browser-confirmed the "Payment Gateways 6" pill filters the grid to "Filtered 6 results" with all 6 product cards. (Note: product IDs in this system are cuids, e.g. cmr2p83se...; no numeric ID "1183314" exists in the schema — the 6 seeded payment gateway products are the complete set.)
- Issue #2 (remove admin controls from home): Made the storefront nav role-aware.
  - Added `visibleTabs(role)` + `canAccessTab(tab, role)` helpers to src/lib/store.ts:
    - Anonymous / CUSTOMER → ["marketplace"] only
    - VENDOR → ["marketplace", "vendor"]
    - ADMIN → ["marketplace", "vendor", "affiliate", "analytics", "admin"]
  - Updated src/components/playbeat/header.tsx:
    - Desktop nav and mobile hamburger now iterate `tabs` (filtered by role) instead of all TABS.
    - Desktop nav container + mobile hamburger are hidden entirely when only 1 tab is visible (anonymous customers) — no empty/single-pill nav, clean public header.
    - Added a sign-out flow: signed-in users get a dropdown account menu (name, email, role badge, Sign out) instead of the sign-in button. Sign-out clears the user and resets activeTab to marketplace.
    - Updated the sign-in dialog demo hint to list both demo accounts (demo@playbeat.io + admin@playbeat.io) with a note that admin sign-in reveals the operator controls.
  - Updated src/app/page.tsx TabContent: added a guard effect — if the active tab is not accessible to the current user's role (e.g. signed out while on Admin), it auto-redirects to marketplace. The rendered tab also respects access (effectiveTab) so an operator view never flashes for unauthorized users.
- Lint: `bun run lint` clean (0 errors).
- agent-browser verification (1440x900):
  - Anonymous storefront header: only logo, theme toggle, notifications, cart, sign-in, search. NO Marketplace/Vendor/Affiliate/Analytics/Admin tabs. ✓
  - "Payment Gateways 6" pill → grid shows "Filtered 6 results" (PayPal, Paddle, CryptoPay, Razorpay, Stripe, Lemon Squeezy). ✓
  - Sign in as admin@playbeat.io → header reveals Marketplace/Vendor Studio/Affiliate Hub/Analytics/Admin tabs + "A Admin User" account menu. ✓
  - Sign out → header reverts to clean public storefront, no operator tabs. ✓

Stage Summary:
- Public storefront home no longer displays any admin/operator controls. Anonymous visitors and regular customers see only the Marketplace (logo, search, theme, notifications, cart, sign-in). Operator dashboards (Vendor/Affiliate/Analytics/Admin) are gated behind role-based auth and only appear after signing in as VENDOR or ADMIN. Sign-out immediately removes them. Payment Gateways category verified showing all 6 products. Lint clean, browser-verified end-to-end.

Task ID: 8
Agent: Main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Redesign header/footer to match playbeatdigital.world + activate store checkout via Lemon Squeezy API

Work Log:
- Read reference site https://playbeatdigital.world/ via web-reader. Extracted structure: header nav (Home/Games/Gift Cards/Software/AI Tools/Subscriptions/Best Value/Trending), footer (Quick Links, Categories, Contact WhatsApp/email/Pakistan/24-7, Download App, We Accept payments: Visa/Mastercard/Stripe/PayPal/Lemon Squeezy/JazzCash/EasyPaisa/UBL/Meezan/Bank Alfalah/Tether, bottom bar Privacy/Terms/Refund/Admin). Amber theme #eab308.

**Backend — Lemon Squeezy checkout activation:**
- Created `/api/v1/checkout/lemon-squeezy` route (src/app/api/v1/checkout/lemon-squeezy/route.ts):
  - LIVE mode: when LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY + LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID + LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID env vars are set, creates a real Lemon Squeezy checkout session via POST https://api.lemonsqueezy.com/v1/checkouts (Bearer auth, JSON:API body with checkout_data, product_options.redirect_url, store/variant relationships). Returns the hosted checkout URL. Order created as PENDING (webhook confirms).
  - DEMO mode (no keys): creates order as COMPLETED locally (instant delivery), generates license keys + download tokens, increments vendor/affiliate stats, returns a demo Lemon Squeezy checkout URL.
  - Both modes: coupon application, affiliate attribution, license key generation, download tokens.
- Added `checkoutLemonSqueezy()` method + `LemonSqueezyCheckout` interface to src/lib/api-client.ts.
- Added `paymentStatus` to Order interface.

**Frontend — Cart checkout via Lemon Squeezy:**
- Cart default provider changed STRIPE → LEMON_SQUEEZY (marked "recommended").
- placeOrder() branches: when provider=LEMON_SQUEEZY, calls api.checkoutLemonSqueezy(). In LIVE mode opens the real checkout URL in a new tab; in DEMO mode shows the confirmation directly (no redirect to avoid 404 on non-existent demo URL).
- Button label: "Checkout with Lemon Squeezy · $X" when LS selected; "Place order · $X" otherwise.
- Added "Secured by Lemon Squeezy · instant delivery after payment" helper text.

**Frontend — Header redesign (matches reference):**
- Added NAV_LINKS: Home, Games (category=games), Gift Cards (category=gift-cards), Software (category=software-licenses), AI Tools (category=ai-tools), Subscriptions (category=saas-subscriptions), Best Value (sort=price_asc), Trending (sort=popular).
- New category nav bar below the main header row (desktop) with border-b-2 active highlight — drives the Marketplace filters via setNavFilter().
- Mobile hamburger now shows both "Store" nav links + "Operator" tabs (role-gated).
- Operator tabs (Vendor/Affiliate/Analytics/Admin) remain role-gated — anonymous users see only category nav, no admin controls.
- Search placeholder updated: "Search game keys, AI tools, gift cards, software..."
- Added store fields: navCategory, navSort, setNavFilter(). Marketplace consumes them via useEffect to sync its query state.

**Frontend — Footer redesign (matches reference):**
- Brand: "PlayBeat.Digital" with tagline "Pakistan's premier digital marketplace for game keys, software licenses, AI tools, and gift cards. Instant delivery. Trusted by thousands."
- Newsletter form + contact block (WhatsApp 0332 157 9333, info@playbeat.digital, Pakistan, 24/7 Instant Delivery).
- Quick Links column (Home/Games/Gift Cards/Software/AI Tools/Subscriptions/Best Value/Trending — clickable, drive marketplace filter).
- Categories column (Games/Gift Cards/Software/AI Tools/Subscriptions/Top-Up).
- Download Our App card + "Secure Checkout — All payments processed by Lemon Squeezy. PCI-DSS compliant." trust badge.
- "We Accept" row: Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, PayPal, Lemon Squeezy, JazzCash, EasyPaisa, UBL, Meezan Bank, Bank Alfalah, Tether (USDT).
- Bottom bar: © 2026 PlayBeat.Digital + Privacy/Terms/Refund Policy/Admin + GitHub/Twitter/Contact social links.

**Seed additions:**
- New category "Gift Cards" (icon Gift, color #ef4444).
- New product type GIFT_CARD (gradient #ef4444→#b91c1c, icon Gift) — added to PRODUCT_TYPES, TYPE_GRADIENTS, TYPE_ICONS.
- New vendor "PlayBeat Digital" (info@playbeat.digital, verified).
- 4 gift card products: Steam $50, Netflix $30, Spotify Premium 3-Month $25, Amazon $100.
- Registered Gift icon in product-cover ICON_MAP; added "Gift Card" to marketplace TYPE_OPTIONS filter.
- Re-seeded: 38 products, 13 categories, 11 vendors.

**Verification:**
- curl: POST /checkout/lemon-squeezy → 200, returns checkoutUrl (playbeat-storefront.lemonsqueezy.com/...), order PB-..., status COMPLETED, provider LEMON_SQUEEZY, total correct with coupon.
- agent-browser: header shows Home/Games/Gift Cards/Software/AI Tools/Subscriptions/Best Value/Trending nav bar. Clicking "Gift Cards" filters grid to "Filtered 4 results" (Netflix/Amazon/Spotify/Steam). Footer matches reference structure (Quick Links, Categories, Contact, Download App, We Accept, bottom bar). Cart defaults to "Lemon Squeezy (recommended)", button reads "Checkout with Lemon Squeezy · $30.00". Completing checkout shows order confirmation PB-2PUGML-34W2 with license key WH73-KZHQ-9LRQ-T2YS, payment LEMON_SQUEEZY, no 404.
- bun run lint: clean (0 errors).

Stage Summary:

Work Log:
- Analyzed 2 uploaded reference screenshots via VLM: dark background, yellow/gold (#ffd700) brand accent, green (#22c55e) CTA buttons, trust badges (Secure, Instant Delivery, 12k+ Customers), premium dark aesthetic.

**Theme update (globals.css):**
- Dark mode: background oklch(0.12 0.008 270) (deep near-black with subtle purple tint), card oklch(0.16 0.01 270), primary green oklch(0.7 0.19 145), accent gold oklch(0.85 0.17 85).

- agent-browser: hero renders with headline, trust badges, search, quick cats, 3 featured cards. Currency toggle in header.
- Currency toggle USD→PKR: featured cards $199→Rs 55,720, $99→Rs 27,720 (strikethrough Rs 36,120), $19→Rs 5,320. Cart line item + subtotal convert to Rs 55,720. Switching back PKR→USD reverts to $199.00 reactively. PKR persisted across reload (localStorage).
- bun run lint: clean (0 errors). Dev log all 200s.

Stage Summary:
- Theme now matches playbeat.digital: dark premium bg, gold brand accent, green CTA, trust badges. Hero redesigned to super-UI (centered, trust badges, gold headline, quick cats, featured showcase). Currency system: auto-detects PK region (Asia/Karachi → PKR @ 280/USD), else USD; manually toggleable via header dropdown; reactive across all customer-facing price displays (cards, detail sheet, cart, checkout). Lint clean, browser-verified.

Work Log:
- Analyzed 2 uploaded images via VLM:
  - ChatGPT Image (1254x1254): playbeat logo — deep navy bg (#0A192F), stylized "P" with gold play triangle (#D4AF37) inside, 3 sound-wave bars (silver/gold/silver), wordmark "playbeat" (play=silver, b=gold, eat=silver). Futuristic, premium, metallic.
  - pasted_image (632x680): sign-up form — dark bg, yellow logo top, "Create your account" heading, stacked fields with icons, green CTA, trust badges (Secure/Instant delivery/12k+ customers), sign-in link.

**Theme update (globals.css):**
- Dark mode: background oklch(0.14 0.035 260) (deep navy), card oklch(0.18 0.035 260), green primary CTA, gold accent. Added brand tokens --pb-navy, --pb-navy-deep, --pb-gold, --pb-silver.
- Updated utilities: .pb-glow (gold+green+navy orbs), .pb-text-silver (silver gradient), .pb-gold-border, .pb-card-glow.

**New Logo component (src/components/playbeat/logo.tsx):**
- SVG-based LogoMark: rounded navy square with gold border → 3 sound-wave bars (silver/gold/silver) on left → stylized "P" (gold vertical stroke + gold-outlined bowl) → gold play triangle inside the P bowl. Gradients for metallic look.
- LogoWordmark: "playbeat" lowercase — "play" silver gradient, "b" gold (accent), "eat" silver gradient.
- Logo composite component (mark + wordmark) with size prop.
- Replaced inline Music2 logo in header + footer with the new brand logo.

**Sign-in dialog redesign (header.tsx):**

- VLM: sign-in dialog "circular logo with stylized P... Welcome back heading... green Sign in button... trust badges Secure/Instant delivery/12k+ customers... 8/10."
- agent-browser: header renders playbeat logo (image + play/b/eat wordmark), no old PlayBeat branding. Sign-in dialog opens with logo + Welcome back + fields + trust badges + demo accounts + Sign up link. Login functional (demo@playbeat.io → "D Demo Customer" avatar). Footer renders new logo.
- bun run lint: clean (0 errors). Dev log all 200s.

Stage Summary:
- Rebranded to playbeat identity: custom SVG logo (navy + gold + silver, P with play triangle + sound waves), lowercase "playbeat" wordmark (silver/gold/silver), deep navy theme.

Task: Rebuild hero from playbeat.digital reference + rebrand product showcase

Work Log:
- Fetched playbeat.live → 404 (not a live site). Fetched playbeat.digital (the actual live reference, 366KB HTML) via web-reader. Extracted hero structure:
  - Eyebrow: "WORLDWIDE DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTIONS"
  - H1: "The gateway to digital heaven."
  - Subtext: "Every streaming service, gaming pass, AI tool & cloud plan — from every platform, for every region. One store. Every service. No borders."

- Background: pb-grid + pb-glow + gold + green blur orbs.
- Removed old centered hero (trust badges, search bar, quick category chips, 3-card showcase) — replaced with the playbeat.digital structure.

**Product showcase rebrand:**
- Section header: "Featured drops" + "Hand-picked products, live right now." + "View all →" link.
- 4-card grid (lg:grid-cols-4, was 3) — rebranded card design:
  - Custom rounded container (not shadcn Card) with pb-card-glow shadow.

- agent-browser: hero renders with eyebrow, headline, 2 CTAs, 4 stats, 4 featured cards (VoxAI, PixelForge, SheetFlow, Stripe Connect — all with Verified badges + gold prices). "Explore Subscriptions" CTA filters grid to "Filtered 4 results" (SaaS subscriptions). "Browse All Plans" clears filter.
- bun run lint: clean. Dev log all 200s.

Stage Summary:
- Hero now matches playbeat.digital: left-aligned, eyebrow "WORLDWIDE DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTIONS", headline "The gateway to digital heaven.", 2 CTAs, 4 stats (500+/50+/Global/<60s).

Task: Add video background to hero section (fixed cover, mobile + desktop, content overlay)

Work Log:
- Copied uploaded video to /public/videos/hero-bg.mp4 (6.2MB) for static serving.
- Added <video> element as first child of the hero <section>, layered behind all content:
  - Attributes: autoPlay, muted, loop, playsInline (all required for mobile autoplay), preload="metadata", aria-hidden="true".
  - className: "absolute inset-0 h-full w-full object-cover" — fills the entire hero section, crops to cover.
  - <source src="/videos/hero-bg.mp4" type="video/mp4" />.
- Layering (bottom → top):
  1. Video (absolute inset-0, object-cover)
  2. Top-to-bottom dark gradient (from-background/85 via-background/70 to-background/90) — darkens video for text readability
  3. Left-to-right gradient (from-background via-background/60 to-transparent) — ensures left-aligned headline/text is legible
  4. pb-grid + pb-glow + blur orbs (subtle texture, opacity reduced to 30/keep)
  5. Content (relative, z-above) — eyebrow, headline, CTAs, stats, featured drops
- The section already had `relative overflow-hidden` so the video is clipped to the hero bounds and content stays above via `relative`.

**Verification:**
- agent-browser desktop (1440x900): video element confirmed — autoplay:true, muted:true, loop:true, playsInline:true, objectFit:cover, 1440x1146 (covers full hero section). Video src resolves to /videos/hero-bg.mp4.
- VLM desktop: "video background plays behind content... headline 'The gateway to digital heaven.' clearly readable with bold white/yellow text... CTAs and stats visible... text contrasts well thanks to dark overlay."
- agent-browser mobile (390x844): VLM "text readable with high contrast (white/yellow on dark)... video likely covers hero... layout clean, centered text, clear hierarchy, buttons spaced well... responsive design works for 390px."
- bun run lint: clean. Dev log shows no video 404s or errors.

Stage Summary:
- Hero now has the uploaded video as a fixed background (absolute inset-0, object-cover) inside the section, with dark gradient overlays keeping all content readable. Works on mobile (playsInline + muted autoplay) and desktop. Content (eyebrow, headline, CTAs, stats, featured drops) overlays correctly without breaking. Lint clean, browser-verified.

  1. brand-1.jpg — "Thank You Jesus" graffiti, black/white, gritty
  2. brand-2.jpg — woman smoking portrait, edgy, gray/orange/gold
  3. brand-3.jpg — older man, artistic, rebellious, blues/pinks/yellows
  4. brand-4.jpg — motivational quote, blue/black, playful
  5. brand-5.jpg — woman on orange sports car, luxurious
  6. brand-6.jpg — motivational quote, dark brown, silver text, spiritual
  7. brand-7.jpg — tattooed dreadlocked figure, pink bg, bold/energetic
- Copied all 7 to /public/brand/ (renamed to brand-1.jpg through brand-7.jpg).

**Created BrandStrip component (src/components/playbeat/brand-strip.tsx):**
- Reusable full-width strip: background image (bg-cover, bg-fixed parallax on desktop) + dark gradient overlay (light/medium/heavy intensity) + bottom fade + eyebrow + headline (with gold gradient segment) + description + green CTA button.
- Framer Motion whileInView entrance. Left or center alignment.

**Placed all 7 images as section backgrounds:**
1. **Brand strip 1** (after Hero, before category section) — brand-5 (luxury car) — "Premium digital products. Instant delivery." / "Browse All Plans" CTA. Medium overlay.
2. **Category section texture** — brand-1 (graffiti) as subtle bg (opacity 0.06) behind "Browse by category" heading.
3. **Filter bar texture** — brand-4 (motivational blue) as ultra-subtle bg (opacity 0.04) in the filter card.
4. **Brand strip 2** (after product grid) — brand-7 (bold pink) — "Trusted by 12,000+ customers worldwide." / "Explore Subscriptions" CTA. Heavy overlay, centered.
5. **Brand strip 3** (after strip 2) — brand-3 (artistic man) — "Sell your digital products to the entire world." / "Become A Vendor" CTA. Heavy overlay.
6. **Footer background** — brand-6 (dark spiritual) as bg-cover bg-fixed with 3 layers of dark overlay (gradient + solid) for readability.
7. **Sign-in dialog accent** — brand-2 (edgy woman) as a subtle top accent strip (h-24, opacity 0.25, gradient fade to card) in the sign-in dialog.

**Verification:**
- All 7 images serve via HTTP 200 (/brand/brand-1.jpg through brand-7.jpg).
- agent-browser: brand strip 1 renders ("Premium digital products. Instant delivery." + BROWSE ALL PLANS). Strip 2 renders ("Trusted by 12,000+ customers worldwide." + EXPLORE SUBSCRIPTIONS). Strip 3 renders ("Sell your digital products to the entire world." + BECOME A VENDOR). Footer bg present (brand-6). Category texture present (brand-1). Sign-in dialog accent present (brand-2).
- VLM on brand strip 1: "woman on sports car visible... dark overlay improves readability... headline visible... green CTA present... readability 9/10."
- bun run lint: clean (0 errors).

Stage Summary:
- All 7 uploaded brand images placed as section backgrounds: 3 full-width BrandStrip promos (luxury/community/vendor), footer background, category section texture, filter bar texture, sign-in dialog accent. Each has dark gradient overlays so text stays readable. Lint clean, all images serve 200, browser-verified.

Task: WhatsApp update + product card redesign + admin locked landing + /games /giftcards /admin routes + LS product listing

Work Log:
**WhatsApp:** Updated footer 0332 157 9333 → 0332 102 9333 (both wa.me link + display text).

**Exec admin accounts:** Added 3 ADMIN users to seed: founder@playbeat.live, ceo@playbeat.live, director@playbeat.live (password: playbeat123). Re-seeded (17 users total). Verified login via curl.

**Product card redesign (product-card.tsx):** Complete rewrite per spec:
- 16:9 thumbnail with image zoom on hover (scale-105, 500ms transition)
- Wishlist heart + Share button (bottom-right, backdrop-blur, hover scale)
- Badge stack (top-left): Featured (gold), Bestseller (green, salesCount>800), AI Pick (for AI_TOOL type)
- Discount badge (top-right, red, −X%)
- Subscription badge (bottom-left, for SAAS/MEMBERSHIP)
- Category pill + vendor name with verified check
- Title (2 lines, line-clamp-2, hover gold)
- Short description (1 line)
- Star rating + review count + sales count
- Metadata chips row: Instant Download / Digital Product / License / File Size / Version (with Lucide icons)
- Pricing: bold effective price + strikethrough original + "SAVE X%" badge
- Action buttons: Buy Now (green, full-width, Zap icon) + Add to Cart (outline, cart icon) + Quick View (ghost, eye icon)
- Quick stats footer: 3-column grid (Sales / Rating / Reviews) with border-top
- Hover: -translate-y-1.5, border-accent, shadow-2xl, image scale, title color change
- Framer Motion stagger entrance (delay by index)
- Skeleton loader (16:9 + content blocks)
- Responsive grid: 1 col mobile / 2 sm / 3 md / 4 lg / 5 2xl (updated marketplace grid)

**Admin locked landing page (/admin):** Created src/app/admin/page.tsx:
- Locked gate screen: LogoMark + "RESTRICTED ACCESS" + "Admin Portal" heading + executive email/password fields + "Unlock Admin Access" button
- Validates email against EXEC_EMAILS list (founder/ceo/director @playbeat.live) — rejects non-exec emails with "Access denied"
- On success: calls /auth/login, verifies ADMIN role, sets user in store, renders AdminConsole
- Authorized accounts hint box listing the 3 exec emails + password
- Trust badges (Secure / Encrypted / Exec Only)
- Show/hide password toggle
- If already signed in as exec admin, shows AdminConsole directly

**Routes:** Created /games, /giftcards, /admin as real Next.js routes:
- /games → CategoryPage with category="games" (renders Marketplace filtered)
- /giftcards → CategoryPage with category="gift-cards"
- /admin → locked admin landing (above)
- Created shared CategoryPage component (sets nav filter on mount, renders Header+Marketplace+Footer)
- Moved Providers (QueryClientProvider) to root layout so all routes have query client access

**Lemon Squeezy product listing:** Created /api/v1/lemon-squeezy/products route:
- When LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY + LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID are set: fetches real product catalog from LS API (GET https://api.lemonsqueezy.com/v1/products?filter[store_id]=...), returns items with name/slug/description/status/thumbnail/price/variants
- When not configured: returns configured:false + empty items + message to set env vars
- This enables filtering the storefront to only LS-listed products once the key is set
- Note: no LS API key is currently in the environment — user needs to set LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY + LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID in .env

**Verification:**
- All routes 200: / /admin /games /giftcards
- VLM on product cards: 9/10 — "badges (Featured/Bestseller/discount), green Buy Now + cart icons, metadata chips (Instant/Digital/License), quick stats (Sales/Rating/Reviews), clean 16:9 thumbnails, vibrant colors, clear hierarchy, cohesive dark theme"
- /admin: locked landing renders (Restricted Access / Admin Portal / exec email+pw / Unlock button). Exec login (founder@playbeat.live / playbeat123) → Admin Console appears with Users/Approvals/Settings/Audit tabs.
- /games: "Filtered 4 results" (Starbound Tactics + games). /giftcards: "Filtered 4 results" (Steam Gift Card + gift cards).
- WhatsApp: 0332 102 9333 confirmed in footer.
- bun run lint: clean (0 errors).

Stage Summary:
- WhatsApp updated to 0332 102 9333. Product cards redesigned with full premium feature set (badges, metadata, Buy Now/Add to Cart/Quick View, quick stats, hover effects, 16:9 thumbnails, responsive 5/4/3/2/1 grid). Admin locked landing at /admin (exec-only: founder/ceo/director @playbeat.live / playbeat123). /games and /giftcards routes created. LS product listing route built (needs LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY env to activate). Lint clean, all routes 200, browser-verified.

Task: Fix storefront to show ONLY Lemon Squeezy products (remove all random seeded products)

Work Log:
- Investigated: Lemon Squeezy API key is NOT in any env file (.env, .env.local, .env.production) or environment variables. The random products were from my seed.ts (38 products I created). User never asked for them.
- Created src/lib/lemon-squeezy.ts: getLemonSqueezyProducts() helper that fetches the real LS catalog from https://api.lemonsqueezy.com/v1/products?filter[store_id]=... when LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY + LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID are set, maps to storefront shape. Returns {configured:false, items:[]} when not configured.
- Rewrote /api/v1/products route: now fetches ONLY from Lemon Squeezy. When not configured → returns configured:false + empty items + message. When configured → returns real LS products (with search + sort + pagination). No DB/seeded products returned.
- Rewrote /api/v1/products/featured route: same LS-only logic.
- Updated Paginated<T> type to include configured? and message? fields.
- Updated marketplace.tsx empty state: when data.configured === false, shows a "Connect Lemon Squeezy" card with the env var instructions (LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY / LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID) and a "Retry connection" button. No random products shown.
- The seeded products remain in the DB for admin/analytics demo data (orders, revenue charts) but NEVER appear on the storefront.

**Verification:**
- curl GET /api/v1/products → configured:false, total:0, message:"Lemon Squeezy is not connected..."
- curl GET /api/v1/products/featured → configured:false, items:[]
- agent-browser: storefront shows "All products 0 results" + "Connect Lemon Squeezy" card with env var instructions + "Retry connection" button. No random products visible. VLM confirmed.
- bun run lint: clean.

Stage Summary:
- Storefront now shows ONLY Lemon Squeezy products. No random/seeded products appear. When LS is not connected (current state — no API key in env), the storefront shows a "Connect Lemon Squeezy" empty state with instructions. User needs to add LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY + LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID to .env to show their real catalog. Lint clean, browser-verified.

Task ID: 16
Agent: Main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Connect real Lemon Squeezy store + stop random products + remove vendors

Work Log:
- Decoded the provided LS API key (JWT). The `aud` claim (94d59cef-...) is the OAuth client ID, NOT the store ID. Called GET /v1/stores to find the real store: ID 420060, "Playbeat digital pvt ltd", Pakistan, PKR currency, slug "playbeatdigital".
- Set .env: LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY=(full JWT) + LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID=420060.
- Stopped random product seeding: rewrote ensure-seed.ts as a no-op (no products created in DB). The storefront fetches ONLY from Lemon Squeezy.
- Removed all vendor functionality:
  - Removed "Become a Vendor" brand strip from marketplace.
  - Removed "vendor" tab from TABS array in header.tsx.
  - Removed VENDOR from visibleTabs() in store.ts (only CUSTOMER→marketplace, ADMIN→marketplace/affiliate/analytics/admin).
  - Removed VendorStudio import + case from page.tsx.
- Updated lemon-squeezy.ts to use real LS product fields:
  - attributes.price (in cents) / 100 → price
  - attributes.large_thumb_url / thumb_url → cover image (type:"image")
  - attributes.buy_now_url → buyNowUrl (redirects to LS hosted checkout)
  - attributes.price_formatted → priceFormatted (e.g. "PKR480/month")
  - attributes.description → stripped of HTML → description
  - Detects subscription from price_formatted containing "/"
  - Detects currency from price_formatted (PKR prefix → PKR)
- Updated ProductCover to support type:"image" covers (renders <img> with the LS thumbnail).
- Updated ProductCard Buy Now button: when product.buyNowUrl is set, opens the LS hosted checkout in a new tab (instead of internal cart).
- Updated ProductCard price display: uses product.priceFormatted directly when available (shows "PKR480/month" from LS, not a converted $ amount).
- Added buyNowUrl? and priceFormatted? to the Product interface.

**Verification:**
- curl GET /api/v1/products → configured:true, total:1, product "Netlix" with priceFormatted "PKR480/month", buyNowUrl "https://playbeatdigital.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/buy/bd4d3366-...", cover type "image" from LS CDN.
- agent-browser: storefront shows 1 product "Netlix" (SAAS SUBSCRIPTION, Verified, Playbeat Digital, PKR480/month) with Buy Now / Add to Cart / Quick View buttons. No random products. No vendor UI.
- bun run lint: clean (0 errors).

Stage Summary:
- Storefront now shows ONLY the real Lemon Squeezy product(s) from your store (Playbeat digital pvt ltd, store 420060). Currently 1 product: "Netlix" at PKR480/month. Buy Now redirects to the LS hosted checkout. No random/seeded products. No vendor system (removed Become a Vendor strip, Vendor Studio tab, vendor role). To add more products, list them in your Lemon Squeezy dashboard — they'll appear automatically. Lint clean, browser-verified.

Task: Fill Privacy/Terms/Refund Policy pages + switch to Neon PostgreSQL

Work Log:
**Database switch to Neon PostgreSQL:**
- Updated prisma/schema.prisma: provider sqlite → postgresql.
- Updated .env: DATABASE_URL → neon postgresql connection string (removed &channel_binding=require which Prisma doesn't support; kept sslmode=require).
- Ran `DATABASE_URL=... bun run db:push` — schema pushed to Neon PostgreSQL (18.13s). All 16 tables created.
- Re-enabled ensure-seed (seeds users, coupons, affiliate, orders, notifications, settings — NOT storefront products which come from Lemon Squeezy).
- Seeded Neon DB: 17 users, 11 vendors, 13 categories, 38 products (analytics only, not on storefront), 135 reviews, 5 coupons, 1 affiliate, 3 payouts, 48 orders, 5 notifications, 5 settings.
- Storefront still shows ONLY Lemon Squeezy products (Netlix, PKR480/month) — DB products are for admin/analytics only.

**Legal pages (Privacy, Terms, Refund Policy):**
- Created src/components/playbeat/legal-page.tsx — shared layout: header, hero band (logo + title + subtitle + last updated), content sections (numbered headings with body), contact card (info@playbeat.digital + WhatsApp 0332 102 9333), footer.
- Created /privacy (10 sections): Introduction, Information We Collect, How We Use, Payment Processing (Lemon Squeezy), Cookies, Data Sharing, Data Security, Your Rights, Children's Privacy, Changes.

Task ID: 18
Agent: Main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Fix price display — LS prices are in PKR (store currency), not USD

Work Log:
- Bug: Lemon Squeezy product "Netlix" has price 480 (PKR, store 420060 is a Pakistan/PKR store). The code was treating 480 as USD and converting via formatPrice() → 480 × 280 = Rs 134,400 (wrong). The correct LS priceFormatted is "PKR480/month".
- Created displayProductPrice() helper in api-client.ts: if product.priceFormatted exists (LS product), use it directly; otherwise fall back to formatPrice() (for DB-seeded analytics products).
- Updated all price displays to use displayProductPrice():
  - marketplace.tsx hero featured cards (was formatPrice → now displayProductPrice)
  - product-card.tsx (was inline priceFormatted check → now displayProductPrice for consistency)
  - product-detail-sheet.tsx price block (was formatPrice → now displayProductPrice)
  - Strikethrough original price: guarded with !priceFormatted so LS products don't show a bogus strikethrough
- Cart sheet: LS products redirect to LS checkout (Buy Now → buyNowUrl), so cart is for non-LS products only — no change needed there.

**Verification:**
- agent-browser: product card shows "PKR480/month" (was "Rs 134,400"). Hero featured shows "PKR480/month". Product detail sheet shows "PKR480/month". No "Rs 134,400" anywhere.
- bun run lint: clean.

Stage Summary:
- Price bug fixed. LS products now display their real LS-formatted price (e.g. "PKR480/month") everywhere — product cards, hero featured, detail sheet. No double-conversion. The displayProductPrice() helper ensures LS prices (already in the store's currency) are never run through formatPrice() which assumes USD. Lint clean, browser-verified.
