Task: Frontend — PlayBeat Storefront UI (Marketplace + Vendor Studio + Affiliate Hub + Analytics + Admin Console, cart, product detail sheet, header, footer)

Work Log:
- Read prior worklog (Tasks 1–3) and verified backend endpoints via curl (products, featured, product/[slug], categories, vendors, vendors/[slug], affiliates/stats, analytics/dashboard, notifications, admin/users, coupons/validate, orders, auth/login) — all returning 200 with expected payloads.
- Created `src/lib/api-client.ts`: full TypeScript interfaces (Product, ProductCover, Category, Vendor, VendorDetail, Review, RatingBreakdown, Notification, Paginated, AffiliateStats, AnalyticsDashboard, AdminUser, Order, OrderItem, CouponValidation) + typed `api` fetch helpers with centralized error handling, money/date/number formatters, and `buildProductQuery()` URL builder. All fetches use relative `/api/v1/...` paths.
- Created `src/lib/store.ts`: Zustand store with `persist` middleware. State: activeTab, cart (with addToCart/removeFromCart/updateQuantity/clearCart/cartCount/cartSubtotal), cartOpen, selectedProductSlug, favorites, appliedCoupon, searchQuery, user. Persists cart + favorites + user + searchQuery to localStorage under `playbeat-storage`.

Cover + title + vendor + verified badge + StarRating. Price block with effectivePrice + strikethrough + discount % + license/version/fileSize info pills. Description, tags as badges, changelog list. Reviews section: rating summary (big number + stars + total) + 5★→1★ breakdown bars with Progress component + reviews list (author avatar, verified badge, stars, title, comment, vendor reply callout). Add-review form with StarRating input + title Input + comment Textarea + submit → POST /reviews → toast + invalidate. "Sign in to leave a review" notice when not logged in. Footer: Add to cart + Buy now buttons.
- Created `src/components/playbeat/cart-sheet.tsx`: right-side Sheet. Title "Your cart" + item count badge. Empty state (ShoppingBag icon + Browse products button).

- Rewrote `src/app/page.tsx` (orchestrator, 'use client'): wraps everything in `<Providers>`. Root `<div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-background">` → `<Header />` (sticky) → `<main className="flex-1">` with AnimatePresence + motion.div tab transitions (fade/slide) switching on activeTab (marketplace/vendor/affiliate/analytics/admin) → `<Footer />` (with mt-auto) → `<ProductDetailSheet />` + `<CartSheet />` global overlays.

Self-check:
- `bun run lint` → PASSES clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). Fixed 2 issues during dev: (1) added missing `Star` import in product-detail-sheet, (2) replaced JSX `<Icon />` with `React.createElement(IconComp, ...)` in product-cover to satisfy `react-hooks/static-components` rule.
- dev.log shows page renders cleanly: `GET / 200`, all `/api/v1/*` calls return 200, no error/warning/hydration messages.
- Verified end-to-end: `POST /api/v1/coupons/validate {code:AI50, subtotal:100}` → discount $50; `POST /api/v1/orders` → returns order with licenseKey. Frontend wire-up complete.

Marketplace with hero+categories+filters+grid+pagination, product detail sheet with reviews + add-to-cart, cart sheet with coupon + checkout + license keys, vendor studio dashboard, affiliate hub dashboard, analytics dashboard with 4 recharts visualizations, admin console with user management + approvals + settings + audit log.

Task ID: 5
Agent: Main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Lint, agent-browser verification, bug fix, finalize

Work Log:
- Ran `bun run lint` — passes clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).
- Verified dev.log: all recent requests return 200/201, no runtime errors.
- Agent-browser end-to-end verification (viewport 1440x900 + 390x844 mobile):
  - Marketplace: header (logo, nav tabs, theme toggle, notifications badge, cart, sign-in, search), hero with headline + stat cards, 11 category pills with counts, filter bar (keyword/type/sort/price/featured), 12-product grid with ratings + add-to-cart. VLM rated 8/10 — clear hierarchy, polished dark theme, no visual problems.
  - Product detail Sheet: opens on card click — cover, price block, license/version/size, description, tags, changelog, reviews summary + rating breakdown + review list, add-review form, Add to cart / Buy now.
  - Cart Sheet: item with qty steppers, coupon input (applied AI50 → total $99 → $49.50 correctly), checkout form (name/email/provider), Place order.
  - Checkout: POST /orders → 201, order confirmation dialog with order number + license key (e.g. QXWL-RXBC-J34X-CMXL) + Download all / Continue shopping.
  - Vendor Studio: vendor header (NovaLabs), 4 stat cards, revenue AreaChart, products Table, active coupons (AI50), reviews-to-reply.
  - Affiliate Hub: referral link (copyable), 5 stat cards (1,840 clicks, 313 conversions, 17% rate, $8,426 earnings, $1,246 balance), 30d ComposedChart, top products, payout history.
  - Analytics: 8 KPI cards, revenue AreaChart, category BarChart, payment PieChart, top products Table, traffic PieChart, top vendors.
  - Admin Console: tabs (Users/Approvals/Settings/Audit Log), users Table with real users + roles + verified + orders + vendor/affiliate, Settings with payment gateway toggles + maintenance + Save.
  - Mobile: hamburger menu, stacked layout, all content accessible.
  - Sticky footer: renders with Marketplace/Company/Legal columns + newsletter.
- BUG FOUND & FIXED: `validate()` helper in src/lib/api.ts only copied fields that had validation rules into `data`, so `couponCode` and `affiliateCode` (no rules) were dropped from order payload → coupons/affiliate attribution silently skipped. Fixed by initializing `data = { ...obj }` (pass-through) then overriding with validated values. Re-tested: POST /orders with couponCode=AI50 now returns discount=49.5, total=49.5, couponCode="AI50". ✓

Stage Summary:
- PlayBeat Storefront is production-ready and browser-verified. Full golden path (browse → detail → add to cart → coupon → checkout → license key) works end-to-end. All 5 role views render with real seeded data. Lint clean, no runtime errors, responsive, accessible. Coupon/affiliate attribution bug fixed.
